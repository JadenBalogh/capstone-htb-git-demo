# Capstone Home Together B Git Demo
Team capstone demo project for group Home Together B. Includes methods to calculate the sum, mean, median and mode of an array of integers.

## Features
In the Main class:
 - Calculate the sum of an array of integers using `getSum(int[] arr)`. Assigned to Athena An.
 - Calculate the mean of an array of integers using `getMean(int[] arr)`. Assigned to Jared Wright.
 - Calculate the median of an array of integers using `getMedian(int[] arr)`. Assigned to Alvin Krisnanto Putra.
 - Calculate the mode of an array of integers using `getMode(int[] arr)`. Assigned to Jaden Balogh.

In addition, each method has an associated unit test implemented in the MainTests class.

## Function Input
Each function should take an array of integers as a parameter. You can use this example array for testing your function:

```int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 };```
